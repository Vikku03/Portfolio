        <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a passionate and detail-oriented AI/ML Engineer with
            over <strong>2 years of hands-on experience</strong> in Python programming,
            machine learning systems, and production-ready AI applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            My professional journey started with data handling and configuration-based
            systems, which gave me a strong foundation in accuracy, optimization,
            and structured workflows. Over time, I transitioned into
            <strong>machine learning, backend development, and AI infrastructure</strong>,
            where I actively work on real-time ML projects, API development, and deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
            I specialize in building <strong>scalable ML pipelines</strong>, developing 
            <strong>RESTful APIs with Flask and FastAPI</strong>, and implementing 
            <strong>evaluation frameworks</strong> for model performance monitoring. 
            Currently expanding my expertise into <strong>LLM engineering, Node.js/TypeScript, 
            and prompt optimization systems</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy converting business requirements into efficient software solutions
            and have experience working in Agile teams, collaborating with developers,
            and managing source code using Git and GitHub.
        </p>
