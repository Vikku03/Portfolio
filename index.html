        <h2>👋 About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I am a passionate and detail-oriented Computer Science graduate with
            over <strong>2 years of hands-on experience</strong> in Python programming,
            software configuration, and machine learning model development.
        </p>

        <p>
            My professional journey started with data handling and configuration-based
            systems, which gave me a strong foundation in accuracy, optimization,
            and structured workflows. Over time, I transitioned into
            <strong>machine learning and backend development</strong>,
            where I actively worked on real-time projects and deployments.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy converting business requirements into efficient software solutions.
            I have experience working in Agile teams, collaborating with developers,
            and managing source code using Git and GitHub.
        </p>
